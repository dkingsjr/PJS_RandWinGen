# PJS_RandWinGen

This code is for a random winner generator. This winner generator was designed to be a fair, random winner picker. When designing this app, Fairness was of the utmost importance. As such, the program has been coded in the following manner:
1) An entry box is used to enter applicants/participants into  an internal list. The administrator of the contest presses the "Add" button to add the participant into the internal list.

2) Once all participants are  entered, the administrator presses the "Select Winner" button. Once this button is pushed, the code automatically randomizes the names and selects one participant. Once a participant is selected, that person is removed to from the list of participants. If there will be more than one selection being made, the administrator can press the select button again, which repeats the random selection process as detailed in this section.

3) When all selections have been made, the administrator can then press the "Delete" button, which will delete all the remaining participants. Likewise, the administrator can click the "Exit" button, OR press the "X" button in the upper right hand corner of the window, to close the program.

4) Once the program is closed, all people who were entered, will be deleted automatically.

I hope that you enjoy this program, and that it helps you in your winner selection endevors!

Please keep a lookout for the exe file that I will be posting, after I get an icon made for it!
